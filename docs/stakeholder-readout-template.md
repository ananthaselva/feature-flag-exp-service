# Stakeholder Readout - Feature Flag Service

## Problem
Managing feature flags across multiple tenants was error-prone and lacked auditability. Teams needed a centralized, reliable, and safe way to create, update, delete, and evaluate flags.

## Outcomes
- Fully asynchronous FastAPI service with per-tenant isolation.
- CRUD APIs for flags with idempotent creation.
- Audit logging of all flag operations.
- Basic caching of flags with cache invalidation on updates.
- Unit tests, type checks, linting, and CI workflow automated.

## Risks
- Cache inconsistency across service instances.
- Serialization errors for nested flag rules.
- Unauthorized access to tenant-specific flags.
- Performance degradation under high traffic.
- JWT token expiry and misuse.

## Next Steps
- Integrate Redis or similar distributed cache.
- Expand test coverage for edge cases.
- Add monitoring and alerting for cache misses/failures.
- Plan phased rollout for production environment.
